TODO:
Grepping through the source code is the best way to find things that need to be done, but here's a list of a few major things.
* Revert change previews
* Anonymous Users
* Better document sharing & permissions
* Zooming with regards to tables and resizing.
* Easier first-time deployment with automatic script group creation.
* Absolutely positioned images & tables
* Better documentation
* Redesign website to be a little more unique.

Dependencies:
* WebSync requires ruby, rubygems, nodejs, and npm.
* WebSync uses PostgreSQL for datastorage and redis for temporary data & pub/sub capabilities. Redis may be replaced with ZeroMQ in the future.
* Libre Office & unoconv is required for file upload & export.

You can install the Ruby dependencies by running "bundle" and the Node.JS dependencies by running "npm install".

Some things can be configured in "config.json" but a majority still require source changes.

----

Launching:
Once the dependencies are installed and running, you should be able to run a development server by running:
rackup
./backend.js

This launches the main site on port 4567 and the web socket server on 4568.

Once the site is running you need to go into the admin panel and configure the script groups.

The production environment is currently setup for use with https://websyn.ca

Some incomplete javascript documentation is available by running "./doc.rb" and viewing the file "public/doc_gen.html". This is also available at http://<WebSync URL>/documentation
